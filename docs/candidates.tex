\section{Candidate Organization}

The required output of 1Click task is a compact piece of text instead
of a list of relevant iUnits.  Given the limited length of the text,
it is still challengeable to contain these iUnits.  Each sentence from
the main search can be considered as a candidate for the final output,
and we need to maximize the overall relevance information within the
length constraint.  In an ideal setting, given some training output,
we could have used supervised learning to determine the best target
sentences \cite{Gondek_al:12}. Without training data, however, the
overall relevance information can be estimated by the sum of relevance
score from the non-redundant iUnits.  Thus, this problem is casted as
an Integer Linear Programming problem \cite{McDonald_ECIR07}.
